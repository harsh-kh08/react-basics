Q. What does React.createDOM method do behind the scene ?

Ans. Behind the scene, it creates a DOM like structure. Like browser has DOM structure, createDOM also creates a DOM structure.

Q. Why the react needs to create its own DOM structure ?

Ans. React compares main DOM(browser DOM) and its own DOM and compares them, and then updates or apply these changes to main DOM

But what browser DOM does that in order to update its own DOM, it repaints or reconstruct its full DOM tree.
This repaint of tree DOM structure is reloading of page

When we say a loading icon on page task bar, it means DOM tree structure is being prepared.
